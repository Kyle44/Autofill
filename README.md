# Autofill
You take in a text file that contains nothing but '.'s and 'x's.  It outputs the board and asks you for the X and Y coordinates to autofill and make all '.'s around it into 'x's until an 'x' border is reached.  The board starts at the top left with coordinate (0, 0) and increases in the X to the right and increases in the Y going down.
